algo_args:
  batch_episode: 10 #Original is 2
  learning_starts_episode: 10 #Original is 2 #Made it 10 to make it consistent with make it consistent with IPPO/ITRPO/IA2C
  twin_q: False #Original is False #If kept False it is the pure DDPG, not a Twin DDPG 
  prioritized_replay: False #Original is False
  smooth_target_policy: False #Original is False
  n_step: 1 #Original is 1 -> keeping it to 1 means considering the expected reward only of next step instead of multiple future steps
  critic_lr: 0.0005 #Original is 0.0005
  actor_lr: 0.0005 #Original is 0.0005
  buffer_size_episode: 10 #Original is 10 #10 to have a size of 5000 which is 10 episodes
  target_network_update_freq_episode: 10 #Original is 1 #Made 10 to make it consistent with IPPO/ITRPO/IA2C 
  tau: 0.01 #Original is 0.002 -> 0.2% #Soft update parameter between 0 and 1 used to decide percentage of target network weights to update
  #Using tau as soft update parameter allows to control exploration vs exploitation and reduce oscillations during training
